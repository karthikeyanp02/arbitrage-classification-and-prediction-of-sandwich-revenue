Classification of Arbitrages and Prediction of Sandwich Revenue in Uniswap Ethereum Transactions
Abstract

In recent years, the increasing popularity of cryptocurrencies has led to a surge in blockchain-based transactions. With the rise in transaction volume, the possibility of arbitrage attacks has become a significant concern for users and developers. This mini project aims to address this issue by exploring the classification of arbitrage attacks and the prediction of sandwich revenue in Ethereum transactions. I have classified three types of attacks that are commonly observed in Ethereum transactions, namely front running, back running, and sandwich attacks. The classification was carried out by analyzing the transaction sequence and identifying the behaviors of the involved parties. I have also identified the specific characteristics that distinguish sandwich attacks from the other two types. In addition to classification, I also predicted the occurrence of sandwich attacks using various dataset attributes such as transaction hash, block number, and gas price. The prediction was done by employing machine learning techniques, and the results indicate a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, I have generated sandwich revenue by analyzing the profits made by the attackers in each attack instance. The generated revenue can be used to assess the impact of the attacks on the Ethereum network and to devise strategies for mitigating them. Overall, this mini project is a significant contribution to the study of arbitrage attacks in the Ethereum network. The project's findings provide valuable insights into the behaviors and characteristics of attackers, which can aid in the development of effective security measures.
